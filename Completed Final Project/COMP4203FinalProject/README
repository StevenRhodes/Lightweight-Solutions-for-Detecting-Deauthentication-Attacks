Note: If you have a Wireless adapter with Monitor mode capabilites then you can follow these steps
		to test the code:
		
		1)Switch your adapter into Monitor mode. (See "Methodology & Algorithm" section in paper for steps)
		2)Run "python detection.py" to start the detection program
			a) In "detection.py", change the filter MAC address to the appropriate MAC address (e.g., your access point)
		3)Perform "Deauthentication" attack. (See "Deauthentication Attack" section in paper for commands to do this)
